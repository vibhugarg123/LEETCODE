    Problem-128: Longest Consecutive Sequence- https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/
    Note: Consecutive numbers can be in any order.

    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
        Output: 4
         Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
        Output: 9

    Solution:
        - Create an empty hash.
        - Insert all array elements to hash.
        - Do the following for every element arr[i]
            - Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence. To check this, simply look for arr[i] â€“ 1 in the hash,
              if not found, then this is the first element of a subsequence.
                - If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with this element.
                Iterate from arr[i] + 1 till the last element that can be found.
                - If the count is more than the previous longest subsequence found, then update this.

     Time complexity: O(N), Only one traversal is needed and the time complexity is O(n)
                            under the assumption that hash insert and search takes O(1) time.

     Auxiliary space: O(N), To store every element in the hashmap O(n) space is needed.
